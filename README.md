`dryad` is a Python module for making predictions using -omic data. It
consists of two main parts: `dryadic.features`, containing tools for loading
-omic datasets and representing them in formats accessible to machine learning
methods, and `dryadic.learning`, which incorporates these tools into pipelines
designed to facilitate drawing biological insights from training prediction
tasks on -omic data.

## Installation ##
The easiest way to install `dryad` is via PyPI:

```pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ dryad==0.4.2```
