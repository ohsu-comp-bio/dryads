# dryadic.features

This submodule contains classes which define representations of -omic
datasets and combinations thereof that make them more suitable for use in
prediction tasks.

## mutations
Organization of genomic perturbation features into tree-like structures
defined by hierarchical properties such as genomic location and mutation form.

## cohorts
Interfaces for pairing the datasets used as input with the features and
phenotypes used as labels that define -omic machine learning tasks.

## data
Utilities for loading datasets often used to augment -omic data, such
as protein binding domains.
