# dryadic.learning

This submodule contains various machine learning methods used to obtain
predictions of features such as mutation status and drug response from -omic
datasets such as RNAseq TPMs and protein abundances.

## stan
Bayesian inference learning implemented in the Stan modeling language via
PyStan.

## kbtl
Kernelized Bayesian transfer learning formulated using the deterministic
variational approximation described in Gonen and Margolin (2014).

## selection
Feature selection methods tailored towards -omic and oncogenic contexts.

## pipelines
Classes for consolidating machine learning algorithms that utilize -omic
datasets into robust and reproducible workflows.
